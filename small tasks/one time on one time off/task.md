# Hello all,

Am having a simple embedded task. Those who Interested can do the task. All you need is to have any development board that having a usart eg (Arduino Uno). 

The task is just to turn on an led when we push a 'push button'  then turn of that led when we push it again. When the LED is in ON condition print a string "on" through serial monitor. When the LED is in OFF condition print string "off". But, you can only print that once, which  means once you change the LED's state you need to print that state only once , if the led is on then print "on"  dont print "on on on on " or " off off off off "  infinitely.

This is just a taks for learning
